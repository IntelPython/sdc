# HPAT_tutorial

## Setting up your environment
This HPAT tutorial makes use of hpat (latest), numpy, pandas, daal4py (latest) and their dependences.

The easiest and most reliable way is to create a python environment using conda:

* Linux: `conda create -n hpattut -c ehsantn -c numba/label/dev -c defaults -c intel -c conda-forge hpat daal4py pandas=0.23 blas=*=mkl jupyter notebook`
* Windows: `conda create -n hpattut -c ehsantn -c numba/label/dev -c defaults -c intel hpat daal4py pandas=0.23 blas=*=mkl jupyter notebook`

Then activate the environment

`conda activate hpattut`

and you are ready to start the tutorial!
