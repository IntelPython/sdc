HPAT Development
================

Technology Overview and Architecture
------------------------------------

This `slide deck <https://drive.google.com/open?id=1jLikSEAqOFf8kKO8vgT7ru6dKU1LGiDR>`_
provides an overview of HPAT technology and software architecture.

These papers provide deeper dive in technical ideas (might not be necessary for many developers):

- `HPAT paper on automatic parallelization for distributed memory <http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3079099>`_
- `HPAT paper on system architecture versus Spark <http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3103004>`_
- `HPAT Dataframe DSL approach <https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.02341>`_
- `ParallelAccelerator DSL approach <https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~lkuper/papers/parallelaccelerator-ecoop17.pdf>`_


Numba Development
-----------------

HPAT sits on top of Numba and is heavily tied to many of its features.
Therefore, understanding Numba's internal details and being able to develop Numba extensions
is necessary.


- Start with `basic overview of Numba use <http://numba.pydata.org/numba-doc/latest/user/5minguide.html>`_ and try the examples.
- `User documentation <http://numba.pydata.org/numba-doc/latest/user/index.html>`_ is generally helpful for overview of features.
- | `ParallelAccelerator documentation <http://numba.pydata.org/numba-doc/latest/user/parallel.html>`_
    provides overview of parallel analysis and transformations in Numba (also used in HPAT).
- `Setting up Numba for development <http://numba.pydata.org/numba-doc/latest/developer/contributing.html>`_
- | `Numba architecture page <http://numba.pydata.org/numba-doc/latest/developer/architecture.html>`_
    is a good starting point for understanding the internals.
- | Learning Numba IR is crucial for understanding transformations.
    See the `IR classes <https://github.com/numba/numba/blob/master/numba/ir.py>`_.
    Setting `NUMBA_DEBUG_ARRAY_OPT=1` shows the IR at different stages
    of ParallelAccelerator and HPAT transformations. Run `a simple parallel
    example <http://numba.pydata.org/numba-doc/latest/user/parallel.html#explicit-parallel-loops>`_
    and make sure you understad the IR at different stages.
- | `Exending Numba page <http://numba.pydata.org/numba-doc/latest/extending/index.html>`_
    provides details on how to provide native implementations for data types and functions.
    The low-level API should be avoided as much as possible for ease of development and
    code readability. The `unicode support <https://github.com/numba/numba/blob/master/numba/unicode.py>`_
    in Numba is an example of a modern extension for Numba (documentation planned).
- | A more complex extension is `the new dictionary implementation in
    Numba <https://github.com/numba/numba/blob/master/numba/dictobject.py>`_ (documentation planned).
    It has examples of calling into C code which is implemented as
    `a C extension library <https://github.com/numba/numba/blob/master/numba/_dictobject.c>`_.
    For a simpler example of calling into C library, see HPAT's I/O features like
    `get_file_size <https://github.com/IntelLabs/hpat/blob/master/hpat/io.py#L12>`_.
- | `Developer reference manual <http://numba.pydata.org/numba-doc/latest/developer/index.html>`_
    provides more details if necessary.

HPAT Development
----------------

HPAT implements Pandas and Numpy API as a DSL.
Data structures are implemented as Numba extensions, and
compiler stages are responsible for different levels of abstraction.
For example, `Series data type support <https://github.com/IntelLabs/hpat/blob/master/hpat/hiframes/pd_series_ext.py>`_
and `Series transformations <https://github.com/IntelLabs/hpat/blob/master/hpat/hiframes/hiframes_typed.py>`_
implement the `Pandas Series API <https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.Series.html>`_.
Follow the pipeline for a simple function like `Series.sum()`
for initial understanding of the transformations.
